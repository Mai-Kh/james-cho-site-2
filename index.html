<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello, and welcome to my site! I'm James Cho, a senior enrolled in 4662W. </p>

<p>This is my first time using git, and I'm excited to add it to my skill set after this semester concludes. My experience with html is also very limited, so getting the chance to learn these new facets of technical writing will be exciting.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I'm in the Technical Writing and Communication (TWC) program and am looking to find a job as a technical writer after graduating.</p>

<p>The TWC program has given me the confidence to communicate my skill set as technical writer, and I'm excited to see what the future holds. </p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>I'm interested in the technology space; specifically, disruptive innovation and consumer electronics. Look out for my name in the next few decades!</p>
